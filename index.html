<h1>setBfree</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the journey of the setBfree DSP tonewheel organ!
</p>

<p>
setBfree is a MIDI-controlled, software synthesizer designed to imitate
the sound and properties of the electromechanical organs and sound
modification devices that brought world-wide fame to the names and
 products of Laurens Hammond and Don Leslie.
</p>

<p>
setBfree is based on the code of Fredrik Kilander's Beatrix organ emulator.
He generously granted us permission to use his code for our GPL organ emulator.
This project reached the first milestone of getting the organ working with the JACK Audio Connection Kit, a usable GUI, much of the functionality split to LV2 plugins with a new IR based Leslie effect and released at <a href="https://github.com/pantherb/setBfree">setBfree GitHub</a>.
